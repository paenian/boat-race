# boat-race
Rules and models for a 3d printed boat race!

The intent is to make a set of rules for small boat races - using gutters as the main track form, but with various propulsion methods.

## Pulse Pump Boat
Using the Japanese shishi-odoshi (scare-deer) to drive boats down a channel with pulses of water - this should allow for non-boat-shaped objects to flourish.

I think it's a cool idea for a boat race because there aren't boats optimized for water pulsing; it's a very open thought area as far as design goes.

### Shishi-odoshi
A Shishi-odoshi is a (traditionally) bamboo bucket with a pivot above its center of gravity.  As it fills with water, the bucket over-balances, turns and dumps out its water.
The noise of the bamboo striking rock is supposed to upset the silence of the garden and scare away the critters.

You can find modern versions in any kid's water park.


### Stream Rider
Boat going down the stream.
