# Summary

Hi there again!

UPDATE TIME!
What's new?
- The "inner life" got's a new desgin. It is cleaner and the air will not left the tunnel anymore.
- V3.1 & V3.2 got a shorter chimney - faster print and more stability
- The pin-rows are now even - Yipiee, Homer J. can sit just right in the middle of the boat!
- The pins become a little bit thicker - so the blocks will fit even better.
- V3.2 is a "classic" balloon boat with exhaust - it's easier for kids to inflate the balloon and in my opinion the boat is more stable on the water and faster.

Thanks to all for the good suggestions and thanks a lot to those who think it's worth a little tip for my next coffee when designing things :-)


Previous text:
Here is my new Version of "Balloon Boat" (V3). Now it is fully compatible with the famous mini-figures from Denmark. 

Video: http://vimeo.com/254343120

It is also much more stable on the water than the older versions are.

Print it, try it and if you think it's worth it, I would be happy of a little tip.

1. Put a balloon over the chimney and blow in the exhaust.
2. Set the boat on top of water and release the "air hole".
3. Have fun!

User dbgeorge printed the boat with 4 top- and 4 bottom-layers. This will help a lot to get the boat fully air-tight.
